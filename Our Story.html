<!--Shooq's code Start here-->
        <div id ="outer-container"><!--div for all-->
            
            <div id="sidebar"></div>
            
            <div id="content"><!-- content of sub topic-->
                
                <div id="subtitle">Our Story</div> <!--Title-->
                
                <p>
                    The content is promoted to people that are interested in history and discovering the heritage of the species that exist today such as how the mammoth and elephant. we also tried to promete it by adding pictures and videos considering the fact that most of the information was either taking from wikipedia or historical websites. We tried to make the content more appealing using those techniques.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, by adding social media platforms we can use twitter to share information and links and Instagram to share more pictures and videos, because it's an important part of marketing, when posting the content of our website in the social media accounts in which will increase the chance that the people can share it with others, and this is a free way of promotion for our website. also it's a great way to increase traffic to the our website  We make use of related keywords so, when the user wants to search for something our website has, he can easily find it. We used the exact names of the animals and the clear name of the website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Adding slideshow images, videos and images within the text will encourage people to use and reuse our website, it's a kind of professional modern website. Furthermore, adding alt attributes to the images is very important which makes the website strong, alt is a title which describes the image and will help us to improve the accessibility of the website if a user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    In order to encourage viewers to use our site we can promote every new content on social media by adding some sort of trailer and to promote them reuse our site we made a well design for our website, arranging the contents in proper way, using colors within the same range, make use of white space to attract the focus of the user, add line spaces between lines by using line-height attribute and let all the lines ends within the same column.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When designing the site future upgrades were taken to an account therefore, we added as much comments as necessary to explain each code line by line, also by separating the CSS, JavaScript and HTML from each other would make it easier to maintain and upgrade in the future. Also arranging the code like placing the tag and closing tag in the same column and using appropriate names for id and class will increase the developer’s maintainability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to make the site accessible by viewers we decided to host it online therefore, the home page name was changed to “index.html”. In case of the high markup validity, we are confident that the site meets all of the requirements. We made sure that the website would meet the project requirement by following the instructions thoroughly. References were made, comments were added and the website layout was made using google drawing per the recommendation.

                <p>
                     We have conducted many meetings in order to create this website, in the first meeting we discussed about the topic to be chosen. shooq suggested many educational topics but we didn't agree with her, the idea was good but in order to apply it we need to add many web links to link to external websites, it's kind of complicated idea. Then she suggested to create a website of Brachiosaurus dinosaur, but Rabab said let us create a website about extinct animals, finally all of us agreed with her because of our love of history.
                </p>
                <p>     
                    There was some dispute in the layout of the website but thankfully we were able to overcome them. We worked together in choosing a layout that will satisfy all parties and also was able to distribute the work among us equally. Each individual chose a topic of her interest to research about.
                </p>
                
                <!--Shooq part--> 
                <p>
                   Firstly, when it comes to Shooq She designed the logo. She has also implemented the mock-ups along with justifications for the designs and code decisions and worked on the “Our Story” and “Making Of EA” pages. Shooq chose to research Brachiosaurus; her reasoning for showing interest in this particular animal is due to its size.
                </p>
                
                <!--Nada's part-->      
                <p>     
                    Secondly, Nada implemented the home page. The home page is the first page has to be done in order to do the remaining pages because it has the style of header, footer, it has the navigation bar, the logo, and other elements which needed to be static for the remaining pages. Nada plane to make the home page at the beginning with more challenges in order to make a professional website, she gets back to us in some parts she plans to implement and ask us for recommendations, she added the logo, the navigation bar, the slideshow, the header, the footer, the copyright, the form, the div of subtopics, Rabab also did some implementations on the style of the home page but most of the work done by Nada. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    She added a wonderful thing below the slideshow, which is the dots that navigate to images of slideshow, the colors of those dots will change when the image of the slideshow to show which dot relates to which image. At the beginning the dots wouldn’t work properly, the color of them wasn’t change when the slideshow images change and if she clicks on one of them the image doesn’t change, then she fixed that problem because she saw that she used the same name of variables. Nada also implemented the Mammoth subtopic page and she used the same style of the remaining subtopics.
                </p>
               
                
                <!--Rabab's part-->   
                <p>
                    Finally, Rabab worked on structuring the sub topic pages, the font size, the arrangements of images, the location of the video and the other features regarding to this page, she did some implementation in all of the remaining pages of this website. She chose to conduct research about Dodo Bird. She took the information about Brachiosaurus dinosaur from shooq and she use that information to implement the Brachiosaurus dinosaur page, she also implemented the Dodo Bird page.
                </p>

                <!--final thought's on the project-->
                <p>
                    In the end working on this project was difficult. The stress of working on a website to match the standard and level that we have reached in the course was really hard, luckily enough we were able to get answers from outside resources to solve the obstacle that was in our way. Working as a team has helped us improve our communication skills and knowledges.

                    Furthermore, by working in this project we learned how to implement a professional attractive website, how to add slideshow in a wonderful way, how to design mock-ups before developing the website in order to have a full idea of how our website will appear.
